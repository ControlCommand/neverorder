        <h2>Welcome to The Never Order Platform.</h2>
        <h4>Are You Tired Of Dishonesty? We Demand A Change</h4>
        <p>Dishonesty manifested in manipulated mediums who possess vested interests 
            to shape public perception by promoting particular ideas  
            through means of deception. The world relies on the demand side as much as the supply side.
            <strong>So Let Us Demand</strong>. We demand a change.
        </p>

        <p>
            A platform for the Order of the Never, AKA Never Order, 
            is a deticated place wherein we utilize the word <strong>never</strong> ad infinitum. 
            As my first website, I wanted to create a platform for those 
            who are tired of those shady organizations accumulating wealth 
            through mass funding to make a certain product seem better than it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving on to more pressing matters, the world is in shambles. A world wherein those 
            whose opinions about the goods and services they consume should matter. 
            They have the power to change the status quo, yet they are voiceless.
            They scream so loud, yet nobody hears. 
            The filthy masterminds of the consumer economy have 
            ears, but don't listen to the appeals of the consumers.  
            This crucial fact alone has prompted me to create this website, 
            so I can document the voices of this world, and lend them an ear, and a voice. 
            Those products must be put in their place. JUST SAY NOP.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, we are still undecided about a name for this fine
            establishment; and thus, the names will extend to the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Never Order Platform: NOP</li>
            <li>2. Never Order: NO</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Though I am personally leaning towards the Never Order Platform, both options will be
            used to maximize disobedience.
        </p>
        <p>Immerse yourself in The Never Order, and disobey.</p>
        <p>At The Never Order, our primary goal involves the IDE process, which stands for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Impose</li>
          <li>Dispose</li>
          <li>Expose</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All At Once, not in any specific order. You can use whatever order: DIE, IDE, EDI, DEI, etc...</p>
        <p>Keeping this real, the Never Order Platform functions in a few ways among many, but with the IDE process
            we intend to review bomb faulty products with honest reviews like so:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I. Impose your demand</li>
            <li>II. Dispose of the poduct's fame</li>
            <li>III. Expose the product</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, 
            and this is a huge however because we labeled it as 'strong' 
            in html for emphasis: 
            We don't know what to write here, but We included this section 
            to give the idea that we have guidelines in place.
        </p>
        <p>
        At a glance, this service seems redundunt because of reddit. Well, reddit sucks.
        <em>Never use it</em>. This is more like a platform you write your own reviews about something
        you would never want your worst enemy to even try; or, may you would want them to try it
        because they are your worst enemy. Anywho, here you write a brutally 
        honest product reviews from your own experience,
        BUT, this place is about your NEVER. This is more like a platform for
        goods and services that you would never order or try. They can be
        anything from computer chips, to 3d printers that you were not happy with.
        You should stay anonymous, or you can write your fullname and address for max effect;
        that is up to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Expose what you are nevering about,
            Dispose of the subject of your never, and Impose the Never. 
            Bring the world's attention to the ignominious debacle of a product or a service, 
            because that is why we are here after all, not to suffer.
            So keep it more about the NEVERS, and DIE--Dispose, Impose, and Expose.
        </p>
